## Contributing Guide

   - _Step 1_: Download Git from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install it.
   - _Step 2_: Fork this repository by clicking <img src="https://i.ibb.co/PD6HY9s/fork.png" alt="fork" border="0"> button on upper-right corner of the screen in the github repository page
   - _Step 3_: Create new branch with your name (for example, see image)<br/>
        <img src="https://i.ibb.co/yW9NcJB/branch.png" alt="branch" border="0">
   - _Step 4_: Copy the forked repository link (see image)<br/>
        <img src="https://i.ibb.co/85xZTGb/image-1.png" alt="image-1" border="0">
   - _Step 5_: Type in ```git clone <copied_url>``` command in the terminal to clone the forked repository to your local machine.<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; _Replace the <copied_url> in the command with the url of forked repository_
   - _Step 6_: Now open the terminal and navigate to the project folder (In this case directory name will be **Treasure-Hunter**) using `cd` command
   - _Step 7_: Type in the terminal `git checkout <branch_name>` command and press \<enter\>.<br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; _Replace <branch_name> with the branch you created in step 3_
   - _Step 8_: Then type `code .` and press \<enter\> to open VSCode at this directory location.
   - _Step 9_: Write your code, save it and [run the application](#how-to-run) to see the result.
   - _Step 10_: Then add your changes to commit by typing in the terminal `git add .` command
   - _Step 11_: Now to commit the changes type `git commit -m "<message>"` command<br/>
